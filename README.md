# Comparative Bioavailability and In Vitro Characterization of Diclofenac Sodium

## Project Overview
This project compares the bioavailability and in vitro characterization of two brands of Diclofenac Sodium: Cipzen-D速 (Branded) and Voltaren速 (Generic). The study focuses on assessing their dissolution profiles, release rates, and overall drug bioavailability to understand their clinical efficacy.

## Introduction
This section provides an overview of the significance of bioavailability in drug development and its role in determining therapeutic efficacy.

## Objective
To evaluate the in vitro release profile and bioavailability of the two brands.

## Experimental Methodology
- **Preparation of buffer solutions and stock samples.**
- **Dissolution tests** using USP-standard equipment.
- **Calibration curve preparation** using UV spectroscopy.

## Results and Discussion
Comparative analysis of dissolution rates, highlighting the similarity in release profiles between branded and generic formulations.

## Conclusion
Both formulations show comparable release characteristics, challenging the misconception that only expensive or branded drugs are effective.

## Experimental Details
- **Chemicals & Apparatus:** Diclofenac sodium, phosphate buffer, dissolution test apparatus, UV spectrometer, and other lab equipment.
- **Dissolution Test:** Conducted over a 90-minute period, with samples collected at regular intervals.
- **Calibration Curve:** Generated using UV spectroscopy to calculate drug concentrations.

## Key Findings
- The generic brand, Voltaren速, demonstrated a release profile similar to Cipzen-D速.
- This suggests that generic formulations can be equally effective for therapeutic use, offering a cost-efficient alternative.

## How to Use this Repository
The repository contains the code and data used for the in vitro analysis. You can review the results, graphs, and analysis files to understand the drug release profile comparison.

## Conclusion
This project provides important insights into the comparative efficacy of branded vs. generic drugs, helping pharmaceutical companies and healthcare professionals make informed decisions about medication choices.
